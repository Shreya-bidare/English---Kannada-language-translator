Project Description
This project implements a deep learning–based Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system for translating from English to Kannada using a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Encoder–Decoder architecture with an Attention mechanism.
The model leverages attention-based alignment to dynamically focus on relevant parts of the input sequence during decoding, improving contextual understanding and translation fluency. This helps address structural and grammatical differences between English and Kannada.
The system includes text preprocessing, tokenization, vocabulary construction, sequence padding, and model training on parallel corpora. The trained model generates context-aware Kannada translations while preserving semantic meaning from the source English text.
