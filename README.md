English → Kannada Neural Machine Translation
 Overview
This project implements an English-to-Kannada Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system using a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Encoder–Decoder architecture with Attention. The model learns cross-lingual mappings from parallel corpora to generate fluent and context-aware Kannada translations from English input sentences.
